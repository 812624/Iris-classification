# Iris-classification

### Model
Model runs on an algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence using Google's Machine learning framework TensorFlow.

The algorithm is trained on the dataset provided by Fisher in 1936 that contains dimensions of three different flowers, viz
Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. It accurately classify of type of species when provided with length and width of Sepals and Petals length and width.
